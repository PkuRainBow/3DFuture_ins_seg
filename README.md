# 1st Place Solutions of 3D AI Challenge 2020 - Instance Segmentation Track

This repository maintains our solution to 3D AI Challenge Instance Segmentation Track, which ranks 1st in both trackA (validation set) and trackB (test set). 
Our solution is a weighted ensemble of several [PointRend]() models. This repository implements PointRend and train/evaluates it on the 3DFuture dataset, 
based on the open projects mmdetection and detectron2 PointRend. We also provide ensemble code on several trained PointRend models.

## Installation
We implements PointRend under the mmdetection framework, note that the mmdetection version here we used is 1.1.0.
We follow the official mmdetection [installation](). We list our experiments environment in *requirements.txt*.
